"# Terraform Configuration for CloudDevOpsProject

This directory contains the Terraform configuration files used to provision the infrastructure for the CloudDevOpsProject on AWS. Terraform enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment.

## Overview

The Terraform configuration in this project:

- Provisions a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a public subnet, an Internet Gateway (IGW), a Route Table (RT), and a Route Table Association (RT Association).
- Deploys a Jenkins master instance and a Jenkins node in the public subnet.
- Makes use of variables, loops, and modules to ensure the code is reusable and dynamic.
- (Not included) Includes a CloudWatch module that creates alarms based on CPU utilization. These alarms notify an SNS topic, sending alerts via email.

# CloudDevOpsProject  

This project automates the deployment of a CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using various DevOps tools. It leverages Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, Minikube, and ArgoCD to create a fully functional and automated workflow.  

## Project Overview  

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform provisions the AWS infrastructure, including a VPC, instances, and networking components.  
2. **Configuration Management**: Ansible configures the provisioned instances, installing required software and tools.  
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins orchestrates the pipeline to build, test, analyze, containerize, and deploy the application.  
4. **Kubernetes Deployment**: ArgoCD automates deployment on a Minikube Kubernetes cluster by monitoring repository changes.  

## Steps to Use the Project  

### Prerequisites  
1. Install the following tools:  
   - [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

   2. Retrieve the Jenkins Master password:  
      
bash  
      sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
  
   3. Access Jenkins in your browser:  
      
http://<jenkins-master-ip>:8080
  
   4. Complete the Jenkins setup wizard.  

#### 5. Configure Jenkins  
   1. Install the **SonarQube Scanner** plugin in Jenkins.  
   2. Add credentials in Jenkins for:  
      - GitHub  
      - DockerHub  
   3. Configure Jenkins to use the shared library:

- For troubleshooting, refer to logs and documentation for the tools used.  



I want to create a README file for each tool specifically based on the files you see, can we start with terraform?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Sure, let's create a README file specifically for the Terraform component of your project. Here’s a draft based on the files I see in the terraform_files directory:

Terraform Readme
The README file for the Terraform component has been created. Let me know if you'd like any changes or additional details to be added. Shall we move on to another tool or refine this further?





You said:
ok, use a trick start the .md code with " and end with it, and for every  break it with \ so I can copy the whole code, also dont include files that are useless like the lock.hcl and so on, plus I want to write details about the infrastructure, I create a vpc with a public subnet, igw and rt and rt association. a Jenkins instance and a Jenkins Node in the public subnets. there is also a cloudwatch module that is not included because I don't have access to it but it creates a cloudwatch alarm based on the cpu utilization and the alarm notifies an SNS topic to send it by mail. do you need anything else? try to say that I made use of variables, loops and modules to make the code reusable and dynamic as much as possible

Edited
I have updated the README file for Terraform to reflect the infrastructure details and incorporated your requirements, such as emphasizing the use of variables, loops, and modules for reusability and dynamism. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli):
   \\\`\\\`\\\`bash
   # Verify Terraform installation
   terraform version
   \\\`\\\`\\\`
2. Configure AWS CLI and authenticate using an IAM user with appropriate permissions:
   \\\`\\\`\\\`bash
   aws configure
   \\\`\\\`\\\`
3. Ensure the following Terraform version and AWS permissions:
   - **Terraform version**: >= 1.0.0
   - AWS Permissions:
     - EC2 Management
     - VPC Creation
     - IAM Role Creation

## Steps to Deploy Infrastructure

### 1. Initialize Terraform

Navigate to the `terraform_files` directory and initialize the Terraform configuration:
\\\`\\\`\\\`bash
terraform init
\\\`\\\`\\\`

### 2. Review the Plan

View the planned infrastructure changes before applying them:
\\\`\\\`\\\`bash
terraform plan
\\\`\\\`\\\`

### 3. Apply the Configuration

Provision the infrastructure by applying the configuration:
\\\`\\\`\\\`bash
terraform apply
\\\`\\\`\\\`
Confirm the prompt to proceed. This will create the defined resources in your AWS account.

### 4. Verify the Deployment

Check the output for details about the created resources, such as EC2 instance public IPs and VPC details.

### 5. Manage Resources

To destroy the infrastructure, run:
\\\`\\\`\\\`bash
terraform destroy
\\\`\\\`\\\`

## Variables

The `variables.tf` file defines input variables for the Terraform configuration. Key variables include:

| Variable Name     | Description                        | Default Value |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| `region`          | AWS Region for resource creation  | `us-east-1`   |

This project uses a modularized approach for reusability and scalability:

1. **VPC Module**:
   - Provisions the VPC, subnets, route tables, and gateways.
   - Located in `modules/vpc/`.

2. **Instances Module**:
   - Creates EC2 instances with specified configurations.
   - Located in `modules/instances/`.

## Notes

- Ensure proper IAM permissions for your AWS account before running Terraform.
- For troubleshooting, refer to the Terraform logs and AWS console.
